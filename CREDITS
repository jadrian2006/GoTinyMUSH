GoTinyMUSH Credits
==================

GoTinyMUSH is a modern reimplementation of TinyMUSH 3.3 in Go, with
additional functions and features inspired by RhostMUSH. It replaces
~76,000 lines of C with ~25,000 lines of Go while preserving compatibility
with existing TinyMUSH databases, softcode, and help files.


GoTinyMUSH (2025-present)
-------------------------

  Justin Adrian (jadrian2006)
    Project creator and Wizard on CrystalMUSH. Designed the Go architecture,
    ported the database layer, eval engine, command system, and all server
    infrastructure.

  Claude (Anthropic, Opus 4.6)
    AI pair-programming partner. Co-authored significant portions of the
    codebase including the softcode function library (475+ functions),
    flight/navigation system, structure/instance system, spellcheck
    integration, SQL module, TLS support, and documentation.


TinyMUSH 3 (1999-2009)
-----------------------

GoTinyMUSH is derived from the design and semantics of TinyMUSH 3,
a merger of TinyMUSH 2.2 and TinyMUX 1.6.

more than 35 years. Many contributors go unnamed here but their work lives
on in every MUSH that runs today. We thank them all.

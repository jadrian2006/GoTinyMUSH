GoTinyMUSH License
==================

GoTinyMUSH is a from-scratch reimplementation of TinyMUSH 3.3 in Go.
No original C source code remains, but the design, algorithms, softcode
language semantics, and help file content are derived from the TinyMUSH
family of servers. Some functions are additionally inspired by RhostMUSH.

GoTinyMUSH is distributed under the same terms as TinyMUSH 3: the
OSI-standard Artistic License (version 1.0), combined with the revised
TinyMUD BSD-style copyright below.
